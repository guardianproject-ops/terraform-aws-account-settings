# terraform-aws-account-settings


This is a terraform module that sets opinionated settings on an account wide basis


---


This project is part of the [Guardian Project Ops](https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/) collection.







It's free and open source made available under the the [GNU Affero General Public v3 License](LICENSE.md).





## Introduction

This module:

  * Account wide policy to disable public S3 buckets
  * Configure IAM account alias and pretty login URL
  * Account password policy
  * CloudTrail setup across all regions



## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-account-settings/-/tags).



It is recommended that the s3 bucket be created in a separate audit account.

```hcl
module "account_settings" {
  source  = "git::https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-account-settings?ref=master"
  context = module.this.context
  cloudtrail_s3_bucket_name = module.cloudtrail_s3_bucket.bucket_id
}
```
